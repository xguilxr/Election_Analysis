##Election Audit Summary

###Although this program is very simple, it hold great potential for future elections. As of right now we can breakdown the total votes per county and how they're distributed to each candidate. In the future, there could be an option to receive the age information of the voters to see how the demography is shaping itself and use it to each candidate's advantage. An option to include voter's genders could also benefit candidate's teams to improve strategy and include all genders.
